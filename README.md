# BI Internship #


This repository contains all code I wrote during my internship during the Q1 of 2014.

One of my goals was to create a **BI Dashboard** and this has been accomplished with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (a lot of it). You can find it in the "CS Dashboard" folder. It works by loading pictures in the folder. These display our data and content (these are of course confidential and you won't find them here).

In the "R Scripts" folder you can find **R-projects** which I wrote additionally for myself and firm. You will always need to have source CSV files, which are not included here, of course, too.
