BIInternship
============

This repository contains all code I wrote during my internship during the Q1 of 2014.

One of my goals was to create BI Dashboard and this has been accomplished with HTML+CSS. You can find it in the "CS Dashboard" folder.

In the "R Scripts" folder you can find R projects which I wrote additionally for myself and firm. You will always need to have source CSV files, which are not included here, of course.
