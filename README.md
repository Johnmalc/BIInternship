BIInternship
============

This repository contains all code I wrote during my internship during the Q1 of 2014.

One of my goals was to create a BI Dashboard and this has been accomplished with HTML+CSS. You can find it in the "CS Dashboard" folder. It works by loading pictures in the folder. These display our data and content (these are of course a confidential and you won't find them here).

In the "R Scripts" folder you can find R projects which I wrote additionally for myself and firm. You will always need to have source CSV files, which are not included here, of course.
